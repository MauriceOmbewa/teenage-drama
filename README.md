## Competitive Analysis and Empathy-Driven Research to Address School Harassment Among Teenagers
### Overview

This UX project explores the issue of school harassment among teenagers aged 15-18. By conducting a comprehensive competitive analysis, user surveys, interviews, and user journey mapping, this project aims to deeply empathize with the target population, identify key pain points, and propose actionable insights for addressing harassment effectively.
Context

School harassment involves repetitive acts of violence, mockery, and humiliation. The goal of this project is to understand this generation's experiences with harassment and create solutions that resonate with them. This work is conducted at the request of a high school principal who recognized the importance of empathy in design.
